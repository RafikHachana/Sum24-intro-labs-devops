# Lab 6 submission

## Task 1



![systemd-analyze](screens/systemd-analyze.png)

![uptime](screens/uptime.png)

![w](screens/w.png)

*Observation*: Most of the bootup time is spent loading the user space and getting to the grahical target (loading the UI).



## Task 2

![traceroute](screens/traceroute.png)

![dig](screens/dig.png)



*Observation*: The latency in traceroute increases for further hops in the route, which seems to be logical.
