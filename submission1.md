Signing Git commits on GitHub involves using GPG, SSH, or S/MIME to verify the authenticity and integrity of the code changes. Verified signatures ensure that commits are genuinely from the claimed author and have not been tampered with, thus enhancing security and trust within the repository. This practice provides accountability for contributors and allows repository administrators to enforce required commit signing, preventing unsigned commits.
